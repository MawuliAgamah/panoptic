# Test Document

This is a test document about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Python is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum. It is widely used for data science, web development, and artificial intelligence development.

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides tools for building neural networks and deep learning models.

Machine learning algorithms can process large datasets and identify patterns. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers.
